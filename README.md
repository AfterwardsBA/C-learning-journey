C++ Learning Journey - From Fundamentals to Practical Projects A comprehensive collection of C++ concepts, exercises, and projects documenting my progression from basic syntax to advanced applications. Features well-commented code, practical examples, and real-world projects.
# C++ Learning Journey

## 🎯 Goal
Master C++ fundamentals to build robotics and automation systems. Preparing for graduate studies in Germany/Italy (Mechanical Engineering + Computer Science integration).

## 📚 What I'm Learning

### Fundamentals (Current)
- Variables, types, and constants
- Namespaces and type aliases
- Arithmetic operations and type conversion
- User input and output
- Math functions and calculations

### Projects
- **Hypotenuse Calculator** - Interactive program using Pythagorean theorem with input validation

### Coming Next
- Conditional statements (if/else/switch)
- Loops (for/while/do-while)
- Functions and scope
- Arrays and data structures

## 🛠️ Setup
- **Language:** C++17
- **Compiler:** Clang/GCC
- **IDE:** Cursor
- **OS:** macOS
