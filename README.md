# C++ Learning Journey
From "Hello World" to Object-Oriented Architecture.
A comprehensive documentation of my transition from Mechanical Engineering concepts to Software Engineering implementation.

## 🎯 Goal
Master C++ to bridge the gap between hardware (Robotics/Automation) and software (Algorithms/AI). Preparing for graduate studies in Germany/Italy, focusing on Mechatronics and Intelligent Systems.

## 📚 Progress Log

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Completed) ✅
- [x] **Control Flow:** Advanced loops, Switches, Ternary operators.
- [x] **Memory Management:** Manual allocation (`new`/`delete`), Pointers, and References.
- [x] **Functions:** Overloading, Templates, and Recursion.

### Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (Completed) ✅
- [x] **Classes & Objects:** Encapsulation, Constructors, Destructors.
- [x] **Inheritance:** Parent/Child classes, Polymorphism.
- [x] **Abstraction:** Interfaces, Getters/Setters.

### Phase 3: Algorithms & Data Structures (Current Status) 🚧
- [ ] **STL Containers:** `std::vector`, `std::array`.
- [ ] **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Big O Notation.
- [ ] **LeetCode Grind:** Practical problem solving.

## 💻 Key Projects
- **Credit Card Validator:** Implemented Luhn's Algorithm for real-world data verification.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe AI:** Built a game engine with a randomized "Drunk Toddler" opponent.
- **Dynamic Memory Lab:** Experiments with Heap allocation and pointer arithmetic.
- **Text RPG Engine:** (In Progress) An OOP-based game system using Inheritance and Vectors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++17
- **Compiler:** Clang/GCC
- **Environment:** Cursor IDE / VS Code
- **OS:** macOS
